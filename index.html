            <h3>Profile</h3>
                <p style="margin-top: -5px">RL Marlow Consulting LLC provides FPGA and USRP design services and expertise. Founded in 2017 by Ryan Marlow and now based out of his home office in Durham, NC. Ryan has worked directly with Ettus Research/NI and their customers. Some examples of this work: wrapped proprietary ip cores into the RFNoC framework to run on a USRP device, developed custom RFNoC blocks that meet customers' needs, devised multi-USRP schemes, using UHD, to control multiple devices for MIMO tasks, and much more. Ryan has also directly contributed to the UHD github codebase. Outside of the USRP/DSP space, Ryan has worked in hardware-level cybersecurity and custom EDA tools that has given him a deeper understanding of low level FPGA architecture.</p>
